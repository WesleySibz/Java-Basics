    /**Java Packages & API
     A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

     Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
     User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
     User-defined Packages
     To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them.
     Just like folders on your computer:
     package mypack;
     class MyPackageClass {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("This is my package!");
     }
     }*/
    public static void main(String[] args) {


    }
}
